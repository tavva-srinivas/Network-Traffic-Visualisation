The most common reasons the IP geolocation service (like ip-api.com) may 
not return your IP's location are:

#########
Private or Local IP Addresses:

If you are capturing packets on a local network (e.g., 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x), those are private IP addresses. IP geolocation services do not provide locations for private IPs since they aren't routable on the public internet.
These IPs are only used internally within a network (like in homes or offices), so no geographical location is associated with them.

##########
ISP Masking:

Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) may use carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT) or other methods that mask public IP addresses, especially on mobile networks or large-scale shared networks. As a result, the geolocation service may not be able to map these IPs accurately.
API Request Limits:

Firewall or Network Restrictions:

Your local firewall or network restrictions may be preventing the API from retrieving your IP information. Some ISPs or network admins block outgoing requests to certain APIs for security reasons.

why public,  private ip instead of a single ip ???

The difference between public and private IP addresses is related to how devices connect to the internet and communicate within a local network. Here's the breakdown:

1. Private IP Address (Local Network)
Scope: A private IP address is used within your local network (such as your home, office, or business network). This address is assigned to your device (computer, phone, etc.) by your router.
Usage: Private IPs are not routable on the internet, meaning they cannot be used to directly communicate with devices outside your local network. Instead, these addresses are reserved for internal network use.
Ranges: Private IP addresses fall within specific ranges as defined by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA):
10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
Example: If your IP is 192.168.1.5, this is a private IP that your router has assigned to your device for internal communication within your home or office network.


2. Public IP Address (Internet)
Scope: A public IP address is assigned to your router (or device if directly connected) by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and it is used to communicate with devices on the wider internet.
Usage: When your device needs to communicate with a server on the internet (like accessing a website), it uses the public IP address to identify your network. The router translates between your private IP and public IP using Network Address Translation (NAT).
Global Uniqueness: Each public IP is globally unique, meaning no two devices in the world share the same public IP at the same time (unless they are behind different routers using NAT).
Example: If your public IP is 103.54.200.17, this is the address assigned by your ISP, and it's how your entire local network is identified on the internet.
Why Public and Private IPs Are Different
Network Isolation: Private IP addresses allow many devices within a local network to communicate with each other without consuming global IP address space. All your devices can have private IPs within the same network (e.g., 192.168.1.x), while your router has only one public IP to the outside world.
NAT (Network Address Translation): When you access the internet, your router translates private IP addresses into the public IP using NAT. This ensures that even though your devices have private IPs, they can still send and receive information over the internet through the router's public IP.

Key Differences
Private IP: Local to your home/office network; unique only within that network.
Public IP: Used for global communication over the internet, unique across the globe.
In your case, the Jio service assigns a public IP to your router to identify your network on the internet, while your router assigns private IPs to individual devices (like your computer) within the network.
